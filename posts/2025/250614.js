    <h1>Glass Flowers</h1>\
    <br>\
    <br>\
    <p>Quiet beneath the hollow log, a fox watches one blade of grass sway. It wondered—not for the first time—what the grass dreamed about. This kind of thinking came naturally to the fox, like rain to leaves.</p>\
    <br>\
    <div class='slides' data-sources='${slides_250614a}'></div>
    <br>\
    <p>How could a plant dream? The fox knew this wasn't natural, yet it couldn't help but contemplate the concept.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>The day wore on and the fox left the shade of the log in search of something, but what? A song? There was a quiet sound in the distance and the fox silently followed it. One step closer to the answer. The song was a mouse cleaning its face with its front paws. The fox liked the song and took it in like nourishment.</p>\
    <br>\
    <div class='slides' data-sources='${slides_250614b}'></div>
    <br>\
    <p>But this wasn't enough for the fox. It kept moving quietly looking for some hidden meaning.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>The scent of a flower caught its attention and drew the fox onward deep into the forest and into the night.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>The fox found the flower and it's pedals danced and lit up the ground around it and the trees that towered above in the darkness.</p>\
