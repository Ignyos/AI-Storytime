    <h1>Glass Flowers</h1>\
    <br>\
    <br>\
    <div>Quietly in the shade of a hollow log, a fox watches a single blade of grass as it sways. The fox wondered what the grass dreamed about.</div>\
    <br>\
    <div>Did it have intentions? Did it wish it was a flower?</div>\
    <br>\
    <div>How could a plant have intentions or dreams? The fox knew this wasn't natural, yet it couldn't help but contemplate.</div>\
    <br>\
    <div class='slides' data-image='./images/2025/06/14/1.png'></div>
    <br>\
    <br>\
    <br>\
    <div>The day grew long and the fox moved on in search of something definitive.</div>\
    <br>\
    <div>Perhaps a song would offer some satisfaction? And there was a lovely sound in the distance.</div>\
    <br>\
    <div>The fox followed it slowly and quietly with each step hope for an answer.</div>\
    <br>\
    <div>The sound was a mouse moving its mouth and cleaning its face with its front paws.</div>\
    <br>\
    <div>The fox liked the rhythm though answers weren't given yet took it in like nourishment.</div>\
    <br>\
    <div class='slides' data-image='./images/2025/06/14/2.png'></div>
    <br>\
    <br>\
    <br>\
    <div>But this wasn't enough for the fox. It kept moving quietly looking for some hidden meaning.</div>\
    <br>\
    <div>The scent of a flower caught its attention and drew the fox onward deep into the forest and into the night.</div>\
    <br>\
    <div>The fox found the flower and it's pedals danced and lit up the ground around it and the trees that towered above in the darkness.</div>\
    <br>\
    <div class='slides' data-image='./images/2025/06/14/3.png'></div>
    <br>\
    <br>\
    <br>\
    <div>On that same day a rabbit was also deep in thought. The rabbit's mind was wandering around the notion that the sky could speak its language.</div>\
    <br>\
    <div>What would the sky tell me I wonder?</div>\
    <br>\
    <div class='slides' data-image='./images/2025/06/14/4.png'></div>
